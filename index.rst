reStructured Text is another markup language that is very powerful, easy to read, understand and write.
Sphinx uses reStructured text files (with the .rst extension) in order to create documentation files.
Its really easy to learn and undedstand and I have created this guide to help with writing more powerful documetation with Read the Docs

   sample.rst

For right now, I am going to be jotting down notes as I continue to use rst (not like i don't already know rst) but I will be including this as a project in my Read the Docs container for those who are just getting started in RTD and something useful to show them how to learn.

.. I need to remind myself to write in some code that will disable this default "how to" project. I might have it disabled by default and enable explicitly
